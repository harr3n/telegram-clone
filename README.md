# Telegram Clone
A full stack chat app written in React and Node. 
<br />
<a href="https://chat.erikolsson.dev/">Live Demo</a> 

## WIP
This is still a work in progress and the app is buggy in quite a few places. This started out as a frontend only project
and as the scope of the project has grown to be a fully fledged IM-app parts of the codebase needs a bit of an overhaul. 

## Features
- Home rolled basic authentication
- PWA 
- ... 

## Why?
Because a project of this size gave me the ability to explore and learn a few things at once, mainly: 
- React hooks.
- Graphql subscriptions on both the server and the client.
- Prisma instead of a traditional database and ORM.
- Hosting a SPA on Netlify

## Technologies used
- React 
- Node 
- Apollo graphql server and client
- Prisma 
- Styled-components
